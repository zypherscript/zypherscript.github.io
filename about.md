This might not be the place where I would complain about anything(4L), I will find the suitable place in the future(if any)

?...

At first, I thought everything would be easy in finding a new job because I have experience.

However, in reality, it's not like that, especially when you're not proficient enough to explain what you have done. In truth, I can explain everything(all stuff that I used tho), but I'm not confident about how much the listeners will understand. If the products/features I have contributed to are not well-known in Thailand, it may not have much IMPACT, and I don't know how to speak beyond the truth(I don't like the way of FITYMI, SMH).

But in reality, there are still many things I need to improve(from interview questions), such as some stuff that I have been using without fully understanding them or things that I have never used before. For the first part, I can create scaffolding projects to test their functionality and gain a better understanding, which is not difficult. However, for the second one, it takes some time and effort, but I find it enjoyable to learn that.

Anyway I hope I get a job before the $$ runs out(I really love the capitalism, CAP).

red flag??/

It seems that resigning from a sw development job(java dev) after working for five years in order to RESET and take a break can be seen as a red flag for recruiters, especially for those who don't try to understand the situation.

I may still be unfamiliar with using new things, and there are many stuff that I hope to use in my new workplace. I believe that I can learn them quickly, and at the very least, I can try to do interview tests to assess my abilities beforehand: Nahhhh you can't!!! Screened and Rejected are my fav words rn :) >>>> My resume(real/truth) is kinda sh1t, I need to ~~fake~~ fix it!

new languages? frameworks? cloud computing? it seems like it's still not enough, when you knew some they need more(don't get me wrong, this is good way for any company :))

...

pray?

However, the reality may not be as simple as I think. Sometimes, we can't control certain circumstances, but at least I accept the reality and do the best I can.

I hope that I won't lose the desire to be a developer because I have to prove myself. I wish myself to be as fresh as five years ago. At that time I quit my job as a quilicy control officer to become a developer. Nothing to lose?

29/6/23: it's been a month since I was unemployed,  I'll update(rm) again when I have a new job. QWQ
